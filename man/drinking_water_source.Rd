\value{
A dataframe with a new column. For \code{\link[=drinking_water_source]{drinking_water_source()}}, a recoded column of water sources between improved, unimproved and surface water (drinking_water_source_cat); for \code{\link[=time_to_fetch_water]{time_to_fetch_water()}}, a recoded column of times to fetch water according to the chosen thresholds (time_to_fetch_water_cat); for \code{\link[=drinking_water_source_score]{drinking_water_source_score()}}, a 5-point scale from 1 to 5 (drinking_water_source_score).
}
\description{
\code{\link[=drinking_water_source]{drinking_water_source()}} recodes the types of water sources, \code{\link[=time_to_fetch_water]{time_to_fetch_water()}} the categorical time to fetch water according to a chosen threshold, and \code{\link[=drinking_water_source_score]{drinking_water_source_score()}} classifies each household/individual on a 5-point scale.
}
\section{Details on the 5-point scale}{


The classification is computed as follows:
\itemize{
\item Level 5: Surface water;
\item Level 4: Unimproved water source;
\item Level 3: Improved water source with more than 30 minutes return time;
\item Level 2: Improved water source within 30 minutes return time;
\item Level 1: Improved water source on premises.
}
